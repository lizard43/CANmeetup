# CAN Bus meetup talk

The CAN_BUS_Shield folder contains files from 
* https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/CAN_BUS_Shield
* Refer to the README file in the CAN_BUS_Shield folder for info and its license
* I'm not using the Shield but this code works great for the cheap MCP2515 controller that you can find on ebay for ~$2.
* Move/Copy the CAN_BUS_Shield folder to your "libraries" folder in your Arduino IDE installation

The connection between the Arduino and the MCP2515 module is SPI
